## The problem

Have you ever tried configuring a Haskell application? If you are not the author
you are usually out of luck and the only way to configure it is recompiling, and
even if you are the author you have to write that logic yourself (reading env vars,
files or cli params), what about partial updates? and environments? or error handling?

## One solution: Conferer

Conferer is a library that defines ways of getting configuration for your
Haskell application and the libraries it uses in a very ergonomical way.
